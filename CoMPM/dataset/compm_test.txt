Roger	Well, I am not surprised at all that they feel it.	neutral
Phoebe	You are not? You see, that's why you are so great!	neutral
Roger	In fact, it is, it is absolutely, you know, typical behavior when you have this kind of group dynamic dysfunction.	neutral
Roger	You know, this kind of co-dependent, emotionally stunted, sitting in your stupid coffee with your stupid large cups which, I am sorry, could as well have nipples on them, and you are like all `` oh, define me!	neutral

Frank	What, wait, you mean like that?	neutral
Phoebe	Yeah yeah.You can do it.	neutral
Frank	You don't do it.	neutral
Phoebe	Oh, yes, okay, my mother could, and I can't. We don't have that ...	neutral

Rossi	Where there is no fear of commitment.	neutral
Chadler	Do we have ... do we have thoughts here?	neutral
Joeyy	Well, I have never crossed the tunnel myself, because if I understand correctly, you are not allowed to pass with more than one girl in the car, on the right.	neutral
Joeyy	But, it seems to me that it is almost just like everything, you know, face your fear.	neutral
Joeyy	He is afraid of heights, you go to the top of the building!	neutral
Joeyy	If you are afraid of bugs ..... get a bug.	neutral
Joeyy	Right	neutral
Joeyy	In this case, you are afraid of commitment, so I say that you are going there and that you are the most committed guy who has ever been.	neutral
Rachell	Surprisingly, it makes sense.	neutral
Chadler	You think?	neutral
Joeyy	Oh yeah. Go for that, jump from the high dive, look at the gun from the pistol, pee in the wind!	neutral
Chadler	Yeah, Joe, I assure you that if I look at the cannon of a pistol, I pee in all directions.	neutral

Mona	Hey! Hey!	neutral

Mona	Okay, here is a voucher of us.	neutral
Rossi	Wow!	neutral
Rossi	Here is a good one!	neutral
Rossi	Wow, it looks like one, like a vacation card, you know, with the tree in the middle and skaters and snow.	neutral
Mona	You know, every year, I say that I will send vacation cards and I never do it.	neutral
Mona	You want, do you want to send this one together?	neutral
Rossi	Together? Like people?	neutral
Mona	Yeah, you know. Good holidays from Mona and Ross.Ce will be cute, okay?	neutral
Rossi	OK.	neutral
Mona	Oh, I have to get to work. So call me later?	neutral
Rossi	Uh of course.	neutral
Mona	Goodbye people.	neutral

Rossi	I mean, I no longer feel like I have a girlfriend.	neutral
Rachell	Do you want me to leave my job so that you can feel like you have a girlfriend?	neutral
Rossi	Is it about Mark?	neutral
Rachell	Oh my God.	neutral
Rossi	Okay, this is not the case, this is not the case.	neutral
Rachell	Oh my God. I can't continue to have this same fight with you Ross! Look, Urrgh, we might have to take a break.	neutral
Rossi	Very well, you're right.	neutral
Rossi	Ahons ah, take a break, cool, okay, do iced yogurt, or something.	neutral
Rachell	No.A break from us.	neutral

Doug	Bing! We are all ready for tonight, at 8 am.	neutral
Chadler	Oh uh, it turns out that we cannot do it. Monica must work.	neutral
Doug	Oh, my ex-wife did not work, unless you call the work of his mother. Well.	neutral
Chadler	Oh, well tomorrow is not good for her either.	neutral
Doug	Oh? Why not?	neutral
Chadler	These are the semi-finals ... of his ... Botchy ball tournament.	neutral
Doug	What's going on in Bing? Do you have a problem with me or something like that?	neutral
Chadler	Well now you just talk crazy.	neutral
Doug	So why can't we go out together?	neutral
Chadler	Because uh ... us ... we separate. Monica and I are separated. Take me.	neutral
Doug	Good god Bing I ... Well I can't say that I am completely surprised, I saw the way she looked at you, and there was no love there.	neutral
Doug	And the way she looked at me, pure lust.	neutral
Chadler	You know, which would really help me to go through this difficult period is suffocating something. I stifle you?	neutral
Doug	Bing my boy, we will overcome you.	neutral
Doug	Now, here is the plan, take your coat, we go to a strip club.	neutral
Chadler	Oh no, Monica would flourish. But in hell with this female dog.	neutral

Joeyy	Look at, all soft and innocent, sleeping like an angel ... with the little potted hands of Emma wrapped around you.	neutral
Joeyy	It's good, Emma, you stay asleep.	neutral
Rachell	: Log away from the cradle, I have a weapon!	neutral
Joeyy	It's good, it's going to rach, it's me. Make the brilliant.	neutral
Rachell	What are you doing?	neutral
Joeyy	Well, I heard Emma stirred, so I came to make sure she could reach Hugsy.	neutral
Rachell	Oh, oh thank you. Very good, now that I'm standing, I'm going to go to the bathroom.	neutral
Joeyy	Here is my darling ... It's not over.	neutral

Joanna	Did he call?	neutral
Rachell	No, sorry.	neutral
Joanna	Why?! Why?! He said he would call. What did he not call?	neutral
Sophie	Maybe he is intimidated by truly intelligent, strong and prosperous women.	neutral
Joanna	Sophie, would you like to get out of my buttocks. What did he not call, Rachel? Why?	neutral
Rachell	Ok ok.umm, well Ah, maybe him, maybe he feels bad because you are my boss.	neutral
Joanna	Embarrassing? Why should he feel uncomfortable?	neutral

Joanna	The only person who should feel embarrassed is you, and you didn't tell him not to call me, isn't it?	neutral
Joanna	Because if you feel uncomfortable with your friend who goes out with someone for whom you work, there are always ways to repair ... that.	neutral

Chadler	And you are turned upside down because you didn't make your best friend cry?	neutral
Mornica	I mean, all I ask is just a little emotion!	neutral
Mornica	Is it too much to ask after six years?!	neutral
Mornica	What do I mean?	neutral
Mornica	Are Sont-Sont-Sont-Sont-Sont as Rachel and I are not as close as you are guys?!	neutral
Mornica	I mean, don't we have so much fun?!	neutral
Mornica	I don't deserve a few tears?!!	neutral
Mornica	I mean we said to Joey, he shouted his eyes!	neutral
Joeyy	Hé!	neutral
Joeyy	I didn't cry my eyes !!	neutral
Joeyy	Go on!	neutral
Joeyy	It's like the end of an era!	neutral
Joeyy	More J-Man and Channie’s!	neutral
Chadler	Okay, I have to ask, who calls us?!	neutral

Chloe	Do I know why we rush?	neutral
Rossi	Yeah, you know the Ah, the girlfriend I told you about last night?	neutral

Chloe	Good luck, with your girlfriend.	neutral
Rossi	Oh thank you.hé, he.rachel !!!!	neutral
Rachell	Hi.ohhh, you have my message.	neutral

Rossi	Ahhhh !!	neutral

Mornica	Ooh! I'm sorry! I think, I think it may have missed the table!	neutral
Mike	Do	neutral
Mornica	Ah,	neutral
Mike	Do	neutral
Mornica	Ah,	neutral
Mike	DO YOU?	neutral

Rossi	You know that I don't understand why they didn't cry. It was a beautiful speech.	neutral
Mornica	Oh, go.	neutral
Rossi	Hé!	neutral
Rossi	Everything you said about True Love, you were right, I mean, we learned a lot from mom and dad!	neutral
Rossi	And this image of Chi-Chi with his mischievous smile.	neutral
Rossi	And what you said about Nana.	neutral
Rossi	Ohh, yeah, she would really have wanted to be there.	neutral
Rossi	And you know what?	neutral
Rossi	I think it was.	neutral
Mornica	Oh good God, Ross! How do you make it do?	neutral

Joeyy	You forget the number of big songs that Heart had.	neutral
Chadler	Yeah.	neutral
Rossi	You know, Barracuda was the first song I learned to play on the keyboard.	neutral
Chadler	So, you heard it, you repeated it, which should mean that you wrote it.	neutral
Joeyy	Oh, you guys, with this joke. I must say that I know that I fell in love, but I'm not even sure I have it.	neutral
Rossi	What, you didn't understand it? The doctor is a monkey.	neutral
Chadler	And the monkeys cannot write prescriptions.	neutral
Chadler	You are not allowed to laugh at my joke.	neutral
Rossi	Your joke? Well, I think "the chef" disagree, that's why he sent me a check for a hundred ah-dollars.	neutral

Mornica	I can't find garbage bags!	neutral
Rachell	Oh, I think I saw here.	neutral
Mornica	What is that?!	neutral
Rachell	I don't know! But maybe if we keep this closed drawer, he will die.	neutral
Mornica	I cannot believe that we are living here!	neutral

Chadler	You still haven't told Rachel that you didn't really offer?	neutral
Joeyy	No! She had the ring, she seemed so excited, then she released her breast.	neutral
Chadler	Joey, you have to tell him what's going on! And what did it look like?!	neutral
Joeyy	I didn't look at him. The stupid baby's head blocked most.	neutral
Chadler	Go tell Rachel now before Ross discovers it.	neutral
Joeyy	Listen, it's not that simple. She said she wanted to marry me. I don't want to hurt her.	neutral
Chadler	Okay, look, do it gently.	neutral
Joeyy	You're right.	neutral
Joeyy	You're right.	neutral
Joeyy	I will tell him now before Ross discovers it and I will be sweet.	neutral
Joeyy	I can do it.	neutral
Joeyy	I am a soft person.	neutral
Joeyy	Oh by the way.	neutral
Joeyy	Two people who see it if you want to check this.	neutral

Phoebe	Okay, Umm is this tragic love story between Cathy and Heathcliff and Umm, it takes place like these really frightening customs in England.	neutral
Phoebe	Which	neutral
The Teacher	How would you characterize the theme of this book, uh let's see here, Rachel Green?	neutral
Rachell	Umm, well I must say that it is a tragic love story.	neutral
The Teacher	Well, it is somehow a fact, but yes. Someone else?	neutral
Rachell	Oh-oh-oh, symbolism! And uh, the-uh, wild manners, who	neutral
The Teacher	Excellent! What Rachel has cleverly observed here	neutral
Phoebe	You have completely stolen my answer!	neutral
Rachell	Well, darling, it was quite obvious.	neutral
Phoebe	Well, how would you know?! You didn't even read it!	neutral
The Teacher	What do you think? You in the blue shirt.	neutral
Phoebe	I think uh, yours is a question with many answers.	neutral
The Teacher	Do you want a one?	neutral
Phoebe	Would have	neutral
The Teacher	Do you just repeat what I say?	neutral
The Teacher	Very well, let's move on.	neutral
Phoebe	OK so.	neutral

Joeyy	Very well, okay, it's great, uh, chandler, you go behind the desk.	neutral

The Stripper	Okay, which one of you is Gunther Central-Perk? Hey, Joey?	neutral
Rossi	Where is my ring? My grandmother's wedding ring? Where is it? Where is it?	neutral
Chadler	Bravo to be cool, guy.	neutral
The Stripper	What is he talking about?	neutral
Joeyy	There was a ring, in a box, on my bedside table, after your departure, it was gone!	neutral
The Stripper	Wait, do you think I stole a ring?	neutral
Rossi	We know that you have just saved time and admit!	neutral
The Stripper	Okay, who are you?	neutral
The Stripper	Robust boys?	neutral
The Stripper	Listen, I don't need to steal a stupid ring, okay?	neutral
The Stripper	I earn $ 1,600 per week by doing what I do; one of you does that?	neutral
Chadler	Marry me.	neutral

Mornica	Oh my God! Joey!	neutral
Phoebe	Hell yeah! I'm going to marry you!	neutral
Mornica	You can't marry it!	neutral
Phoebe	Hey Lady, your day is over! It's my turn!	neutral
Mornica	Phoebe!	neutral
Joeyy	Why?! Why can't she marry me?!	neutral
Phoebe	I can and I want!	neutral
Mornica	It is not pregnant. It is Rachel.rachel is the one that is pregnant.	neutral

Mornica	I mean God, chandle what you have done, it's, it's a wonderful thing and I really appreciate it.	neutral
Mornica	I know I have this bizarre thing where I want everything to be in the perfect place, but I never expected what you worry about it.	neutral
Chadler	Oh good?	neutral
Mornica	Sure!	neutral
Chadler	Well, you are the best. You come here to me.	neutral
Mornica	Very well, do you wait well? First of all.	neutral

Rossi	Okay, that's it. I can't make this decision!	neutral
Mornica	A magic ball at eight?! You can't be serious, you can't make this decision with a toy!	neutral
Phoebe	Ooh, it's not a toy.	neutral
Rossi	Well, I don't know what else to do.	neutral
Rossi	I mean, I keep my wife and I lose one of the best friends of my best friends, I keep my friend and I divorce myself the second time before I am 30 years old!	neutral
Rossi	So if someone has a better suggestion, let's listen to it!	neutral
Rossi	Because I have nothing!	neutral
Rossi	Very well, don't be shy, any suggestion will do the trick.	neutral
Rossi	OK so.	neutral
Rossi	Here we are.	neutral

The Fan	Can-Cans I receive your autograph, I am your biggest fan.	neutral

Phoebe	I think she took it well enough. You know that Paolo is there right now, so ...	neutral
Rossi	Ah ... ooh! Well, it looks like, uh, we have kicked your butts.	neutral
Joeyy	Non, she kicked our butts. You could be in the Olympic team.	neutral
Rossi	Come on, two on one.	neutral
Chadler	What are you still doing here? She just broke with the guy, it's time for you to immerse yourself!	neutral
Rossi	And now?	neutral
Joeyy	Yes, it's when you head!	neutral
Joeyy	You must make sure that when Paolo comes out of there, the first guy Rachel sees, it is you, she must know that you are all that he is not!	neutral
Joeyy	You are like, like anti-Paolo!	neutral
Chadler	My Catholic friend is right.	neutral
Chadler	She is upset.	neutral
Chadler	You are there for her.	neutral
Chadler	You pick up the pieces, then inaugurate the Ross era!	neutral

Rachell	Well, I just called Joshua	neutral
Phoebe	Oh, how did it go?	neutral
Rachell	Well, I did my best to convince him that I am not a crazy girl who dies of desire to get married - I just spend a difficult period.	neutral
Phoebe	What did he say?	neutral
Rachell	Well uh, his answering machine was	neutral
Mornica	Oh, my darling! Hey, I bet everything he will call you again.	neutral
Rachell	Yes, maybe, but I don't think I'm even cared.	neutral
Rachell	I don't think he's the one I am sad.	neutral
Rachell	You know, I know I said that I totally agree with Ross's wedding, but in fact, I don't think I manage it all.	neutral
Phoebe	Yeah maybe.	neutral
Rachell	And I'm just trying to understand why.	neutral
Phoebe	A chance?	neutral
Rachell	Well, yes, you know how Ross and I were still, once again, again, again?	neutral
Rachell	I guess I thought that somewhere on the road, we would be again.	neutral
Mornica	Still. You know what? I think we all did it.	neutral
Rossi	Hé!	neutral

Joeyy	I don't understand!	neutral
Joeyy	It was in my room all night!	neutral
Joeyy	And if she didn't take it, and I didn't take it; and you didn't take it, then who did it?	neutral
Joeyy	Shh!	neutral
Joeyy	We try to think!	neutral

Joeyy	This is the unit for you my friend. Robust construction, tons of storage compartments, some enough to adapt to an adult.	neutral
Guy	Quoi?!	neutral
Joeyy	Oh yeah!	neutral
Joeyy	I arrived there once.	neutral
Joeyy	My roommate bet for me five dollars that I couldn't, then he stuck a board through the handles that locked me up.	neutral
Joeyy	Yeah.	neutral
Joeyy	It was funny until I started to feel in a coffin.	neutral
Guy	No, you cannot adapt to this thing. This is not deep enough.	neutral
Joeyy	Oh yeah? If I can't, I will eliminate five dollars on the price of the unit.	neutral
Guy	Very well, you yourself have an agreement.	neutral
Joeyy	Okay?! I told you!	neutral
Joeyy	Sometimes I get there just to get away from it! Hey, a nickel !!	neutral

Erin	Ohh, listen. I have to go. Today was great, thank you!	neutral

Bonnie	I think I brought half of the beach in my hair. It was so much easier when I shaved my head.	neutral
Rachell	You know, I must tell you, I	neutral
Bonnie	Really?!	neutral
Rachell	Ohh!	neutral
Bonnie	Because I think of shaving everything again one day.	neutral
Rachell	Really?!	neutral
Bonnie	Yeah!	neutral

Bonnie	You know what, I should do it.	neutral
Rachell	Yeah!	neutral

Mornica	She buys tickets for games I want to see.	neutral
Mornica	She bought store clothes that I am intimidated by the sellers.	neutral
Mornica	She spent three hundred dollars on artistic supplies.	neutral
Rachell	You are not an artist.	neutral
Mornica	Yeah, well I could be if I had supplies! I mean, I could do all that.	neutral

Chadler	I cannot believe that you would say that. I would prefer to be Mr. Penut that Mr. Salty.	neutral
Joeyy	Certainly not! Mr.salty is a sailor, okay, he must be, like the biggest snack.	neutral
Rossi	I don't know, you don't want to play with corn nuts. They are craaazy.	neutral
Mornica	Oh my God. The guys! You have to come and see that! There is shift with a telescope!	neutral
Rossi	I can't believe it! He looks at us directly!	neutral
Rachell	Oh, it's so sick.	neutral
Chadler	I feel violated.And not in the right direction.	neutral
Phoebe	How can people do this?... Oh, you're guys, look at it! A ugly naked guy has had serious boots!	neutral

Joeyy	Guy, it was great! Huh? Can you believe how long we launched this ball?	neutral
Rachell	Yeah, it's incredible, it lasted so long.	neutral
Rossi	I know.	neutral
Rachell	No, I wanted to say with the dropper here.	neutral
Chadler	You know, how did I get this reputation for droppings? Okay? I am	neutral

Rachell	Ah, oh my god.oh, darling, oh that's fine.	neutral
Rossi	What.oh no, you just rolled on the juice box.	neutral

Joeyy	Hose.	neutral

Joeyy	What is the problem?	neutral
Rachell	Nothing.	neutral
Joeyy	What is it? Hey!	neutral
Rachell	It's really nothing. I'm just	neutral
Joeyy	Rach go, what?	neutral
Rachell	I just thought about how my baby and I are going to be alone.	neutral
Joeyy	What are you talking about alone? And Ross?	neutral
Rachell	Oh please, he will be with his real family, twins and small Miss New breasts.	neutral
Joeyy	Okay, how long was I looking at this woman?	neutral
Rachell	I just say that you know, one day Ross will meet someone and ... he will have his own life.	neutral
Joeyy	Yeah, I guess yes.	neutral
Rachell	I never thought that I would rush this baby on my own. Shall be stupid huh?	neutral

Chadler	Bob.bob! Bob !!! What are you doing?!	neutral
Bob	I just discovered that it's Chandler's office! Go to Toby, give me a helping hand!	neutral

Mornica	Chandler, we said that we were at the cafe at six.	neutral
Chadler	We said seven!	neutral
Mornica	We said six!	neutral
Chadler	The only way I said six would be if the seven, let meet at the age of seven, not six years old.	neutral
Mornica	Yeah and if I had seven, maybe I would have said something like that, "wow! My boyfriend is such a wise ass - seven!"	neutral
Phoebe	Health!	neutral
Chadler	Oh my good god.	neutral
Phoebe	I know what time you said.	neutral
Chadler	Quoi?!	neutral
Phoebe	Well, I know what time Chester and Marcia said.	neutral

Joeyy	Yeah.	neutral

Chadler	You know, you really didn't have to take me to the airport.	neutral
Janice	Oh please.	neutral
Janice	Every moment is precious.	neutral
Janice	You know?	neutral
Janice	In addition, someone had to get into this other taxi with the rest of your luggage, and your friends don't really seem to worry too much that you are leaving.	neutral
Chadler	Well, we are really not so close. Again, so I guess it's uh, goodbye then.	neutral
Janice	On no! No! It's not goodbye, I don't go before you arrived on this plane.	neutral

Chadler	No, I'm afraid of not being able to make love as well as him.	neutral
Rossi	Yeah, I was going for the metaphor.	neutral
Chadler	Yes, and I said the real words.	neutral
Mornica	So big, so Joey had a lot of friends, that doesn't mean he's great in bed.	neutral
Chadler	We share a wall! So, either it is great in bed, or she just likes to be a lot with him.	neutral
Mornica	My darling, with you it will be different. The sex will be great, because you, guys, are in love.	neutral
Chadler	Yeah?	neutral
Rachell	Yeah!	neutral
Rossi	Go chandler.	neutral

Phoebe	It's good. I must admit that I thought it was something else.	neutral
David	Yeah, I ... Well, I really wanted to say uh, that, but uh, I told myself that I should probably not because you know, I have to go.	neutral
Phoebe	You're right! You're right, don't say it.	neutral
David	I do, however.	neutral
Phoebe	Me too.	neutral

Rachell	I thought I was doing it a cute net?	neutral
Mornica	Yes, you were, but you decided to make salmon because you were left at the restaurant.	neutral
Mornica	And then you realized that if you were doing it, then you would stop cooking, and you should make your famous potato in the oven and cocolo.	neutral
Rachell	Wow, I really become Crabby when I cook.	neutral

Mornica	Chandler! It happens to a lot of guys! You probably tired yourself, you had a lot of champagne, don't worry!	neutral
Chadler	I am not worried, I am uh, I am fascinated.	neutral

Rachell	Good.	neutral
Rachell	Although you know, he is a private guy.	neutral
Rachell	You know, I would like to be able to open it a little, share some feelings.	neutral
Phoebe	It's easy! You just have to consider it as a pot of pickles that will not open.	neutral
Rachell	So, what do you say. I should get it under hot water and bang your head against a table?	neutral
Phoebe	No, that's what you do when you want to remove someone's truth.	neutral
Paul	Hello my dear.	neutral
Rachell	Health!	neutral

Joeyy	Hé!	neutral
Chadler	Hé!	neutral
Chadler	I did it! But the store would not bring it back! So I took it to the refuge, and you know what I discovered?	neutral
Chadler	If they can't find a house for her, they kill her! And I'm not going to let it happen to Little Yasmine!	neutral
